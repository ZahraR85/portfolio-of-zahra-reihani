            I’m a passionate and detail-oriented software developer with over 10
            years background in computer engineering and a strong focus on
            building practical, user-friendly web applications. My career began
            in enterprise systems using SQL and ASP.NET (VB and C#), and has
            since evolved into full-stack development with modern technologies
            like React, Node.js, and MongoDB. I enjoy transforming ideas into
            responsive, clean, and efficient code—with a sharp focus on user
            experience and maintainability. I thrive in collaborative, agile
            environments where learning and continuous improvement drive
            progress.

            These days, I spend most of my time sharpening my skills with
            JavaScript, React, and TypeScript. I've also been exploring backend
            tools like GraphQL and MongoDB, and building full-stack projects
            with Next.js. This portfolio is part of my journey to challenge
            myself, explore new tools, and build with curiosity.
